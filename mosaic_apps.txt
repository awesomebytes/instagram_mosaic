Instagram mosaic:

1) Give a (public) instagram profile, and generate the user profile photo from their photos.
   This must take into account different cases:
   1) Enough photos (fixed number based on the pixels of profile photo 150x150px) are found in the profile --> generate the profile photo from the last ones
   2) Not enough photos --> repeat photos

2) Give a tag and a photo and from the last photos of the tag make a mosaic
